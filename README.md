FYI. it is not fully working right now
I faced some issues and ran out of time. That's why there is not everything implemented and works
Assignment is complex to spend less than 6 hours so I decided to just cover structure.
There are quite a few things could be improved : how to deal with images ( store in db or upload to blob storage), when and how to resize them, what to do if upload went well but db throwed exception and so on.
